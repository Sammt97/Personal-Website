    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <div class="container">
    <div class="info">
  
    <p>Grateful for the journey and purpose that come with being Tj Samuel, I carry a unique blend of financial, tech, and customer service experience gained through both internships and community work. With a dedication to learning, I've had the privilege to serve as the Lead Political Education Fellow and Recruiter at Citywide Youth Coalition, where I help lead member education, and organize civic actions for impactful & purposeful causes. My time at Achievement First Amistad High School also equipped me with essential skills in financial literacy via internship, from cash handling to professional tech applications.

Iâ€™m driven by a passion for equity, with a strong focus on uplifting black and brown youth. In addition to my current role, I work part-time at Chick-fil-A, collaborating with teammates to deliver a high-quality, welcoming experience for each guest that walks through our doors.

Looking forward, I aim to study major within the Business field to become a Financial Consultant for major (ethically made) companies, pursue real estate investment, and potentially minor in Public Policy to deepen my advocacy for marginalized communities. With every opportunity, I am committed to growth, service, and a future of positive impact that will change the environment around me and beyond.
